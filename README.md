This project was very good practice of html and css. I spent most of the first day looking at other Software Engineer's portfolio site to get inspired. After gathering ideas from multuiple sources, I started with the first page. I realized most modern webpages are a single page with the Nav bar links bringing users down to the selected sections. So with that in mind I decided to create one long HTML page with multiple sections/divs where user can link straight to rather than have multiple html pages. 

Configuring all the divs to go where I want was the most challenging part of the project. I am still trying to get good enough at CSS where I can move elements around without trial and error as that what took the majority of my time.  


A issue I encounter was, not being able to get the sticky navbar to be above other divs on the screen. Causing the nav link only working at certain scrolling points.
